## What Meditation Is

Vipasanna is a direct and gradual cultivation of mindfulness or awareness. It is a gentle, but thorough technique, that directs the student to intensely examine their existence and more and more of their flowing life experience. This ancient practice teaches us:
  * attentive listening
  * total seeing
  * careful testing
  * to smell acutely
  * to touch fully
  * really pay attention to what we feel
  * to listen to our thoughts without being caught up in them

### The proper attitude for meditators
> "Never mind what I have been taught. Forget about theories and prejudgments and stereotypes. I want to understand the true nature of life. I want to know what this experience of being alive really is. I want to apprehend the true and deepest qualities of life, and I don't want to just accept somebody else's explanation. I want to see it for myself."

Real peace comes when we stop chasing it. Vipasanna trains us to ignore the constant impulses and dive into reality headfirst, instead.

> We tune out 99% of all the sensory stimuli we actually receive, and we solidify the remainder into discrete mental objects. Then we react to those mental objects in programmed habitual ways... They are just perceptual and mental habits. You learn to respond this way as a child by copying the perceptual habits of those around you. These perceptual responses are not inherent in the structure of the nervous system. The circuits are there. But this is not the only way that our mental machinery can be used. That which has been learned can be unlearned. The first step is to realize what you are doing, as you are doing it, and stand back and quietly watch.

### "Worry" as a process
1. Phenomenon pops up into mind
2. Grasping/rejecting thought
3. Habit reaction/response triggered

**Vipasanna can be used to short-circuit that process.** By scrutinizing the perceptual process, watching the arising of thought and perception while detached allows us to view our reactions to stimuli with a calm clarity. One can see themself reacting without *getting caught up* in the reactions themselves.
