## Meditation: Why Bother?

Meditation is difficult. It requires discipline, energy, time, and determination. 

> Chronic tension, lack of genuine compassion for others, including the people closest to you, feelings being blocked up, and emotional deadness. Many, many arms. None of us is entirely free from it. We may deny it. We try to suppress it. We build a whole culture around hiding from it, pretending it is not there, and distracting ourselves from it with goals and projects and status. But it never goes away. It is a constant undercurrent in every thought and every perception; a little wordless voice at the back of the head saying, "Not good enough yet. Got to have more. Got to make it better. Got to be better." It is a monster, a monster that manifests everywhere in subtle forms.

Change is the nature of the universe, however we have come up with a plethora of weird reactive responses to the everchanging world around us. We tend to categorize these experiences into 3 boxes, and then have fixed habitual reactions to it, almost script like.
* **Good**
  * we try to freeze time in these experiences
  * we tend to cling to these, keep it from escaping
  * we try to recreate the experience
  * this mental habit can be called **grasping**
* **Bad**
  * we try to push it away
  * try to deny it, reject it, get rid of it
  * we fight against our own experience
  * this mental habit can be called **rejecting**
* **Neutral**
  * experiences which are neither good or bad
  * tepid, uninteresting, boring
  * we ignore these experiences to focus on our endless round of desire and aversion
  * this mental habit can be called **ignoring**
  
### You will suffer in life.

> Take any moment when you feel really fulfilled and examine it closely. Down under the joy, you will find that subtle, all-pervasive undercurrent of tension, that no matter how great the moment is, it is going to end. No matter how much you just gained, you are either going to lose some of it or spend the rest of your days guarding what you have got and scheming how to get more. And in the end, you are going to die. In the end, you lose everything. It is all transitory.

It is possible for the mind to refrain from clinging, rejecting, and ignoring. It is difficult, but a learnable skill. And it is a way to happiness and peace.

Layers of surface objectives cloud our basic goals. Often we do not realize that we are basically seeking relief from satifying some urge or drive. Ending the tension.

One must remember that they can never get everything they want. But you can *learn to not want what you want, to recognize desires but not be controlled by them.*

> "What you are now is the result of what you were. What you will be tomorrow will be the result of what you are now. The consequences of an evil mind will follow you like the cart follows the ox that pulls it. The consequences of a purified mind will follow you like your own shadow. No one can do more for you than your own purified mind-- no parent, no relative, no friend, no one. A well-disciplined mind brings happiness". - The Dhammapada

Meditation is meant to cleanse the thought processes of mental habits, bringing the mind to a state of tranquility, awareness, concentration, and insight.

> Meditation sharpens your concentration and your thinking power. Then, piece by piece, your own subconscious motives and mechanics become clear to you. Your intuition sharpens. The precision of your thought increases and gradually you come to a direct knowledge of things as they really are, without prejudice and without illusion.
