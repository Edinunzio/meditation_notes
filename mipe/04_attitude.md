## Attitude
We are part of the world we view, the act of observing changes what we observe. Meditation is participatory observation. What you're looking at responds to the process of looking. What you are looking at is you, and what you see depends on how you look. The following attitudes should help in the difficulties.

* **Don't expect anything.**
    * Treat it as an experiment. Sit back and see what happens. 
    * Let it move at it's own speed
* **Don't strain.**
* **Don't rush.**
* **Don't cling to anything and don't reject anything.**
* **Let go.**
* **Accept everything that arises.**
* **Be gentle with yourself.**
* **Investigate yourself.**
* **View all problems as challenges.**
* **Don't ponder.**
* **Don't dwell upon contrasts.**

### Recommended procedure
> When the meditator perceives any sensory object, he is not to dwell upon it in the ordinary egotistical way. He should rather examine the very process of perception itself. He should watch the feelings that arise and the mental activities that follow. He should note the changes that occur in his own consciousness as a result. In watching all these phenomena, the meditator must be aware of the universality of what he is seeing. That initial perception will spark pleasant, unpleasant or neutral feelings. That is a universal phenomenon. It occurs in the mind of others just as it does in his, and he should see that clearly. Following these feelings various reactions may arise. He may feel greed, lust, or jealousy. He may feel fear, worry, restlessness or boredom. These reactions are universal. He simple notes them and then generalizes. He should realize that these reactions are normal human responses and can arise in anybody.
