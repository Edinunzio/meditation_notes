## The Practice
> Remember that you are not practicing a deep absorption or pure concentration technique. You are practicing mindfulness for which you need only a certain degree of shallow concentration. You want to cultivate mindfulness culminating in insight and wisdom to realize the truth as it is. You want to know the working of your body-mind complex exactly as it is. You want to get rid of all psychological annoyance to make your life really peaceful and happy. The mind cannot be purified without seeing things as they really are. 

While mindfully watching one's bodily sensations, make sure to not confuse them with mental formations.

**Universal Mental Factors**  
  * feeling
  * contact
  * perception
  * mental formations
  * concentration
  * life force
  * awareness
  
### Our Goal
To reach the perfection of all the noble and wholesome qualities latent in the subconscious mind. 
  * purification of mind
  * overcoming sorrow and lamentation
  * overcoming pain and grief
  * treading the right path leading to attainment of eternal peace
  * attaining happiness by following that path
  
### Practice

> Our mind is analogous to a cup of muddy water. The longer you keep a cup of muddy water still, the more mud settles down and the water will be seen clearly. Similarly, if you keep quiet without moving your body, focusing your entire undivided attention on the subject of your meditation, your mind settles down and begins to experience the bliss of meditation.

  * Once you sit, do not change your original position, no matter how painful it is.
  * Determine at the beginning how long you are going to meditate
  * After sitting motionless, close your eyes
      * Use the breath as a mental object for your mind to focus on
  * Take 3 deep breaths
  * Then, breath normally, letting your breath flow in and out freely and effortlessly
  * Begin focusing your attention on the rims of your nostrils
      * Notice the pause at the beginning of inhalation
      * Notice the pause at the beginning of exhalation
  * Do not verbalize or conceptualize anything

#### As soon as you notice your mind is not on your breath, mindfully bring it back.
When the mind is united with the breath flowing all the time, we will naturally be able to focus the mind on the present moment.

### Ways to develop concentration
  1. Counting
      1. Purpose is to focus the mind on the breath
      2. Once mind is focused on the breath, stop counting
  2. Connecting
      1. After inhaling do not wait to notice the brief pause before exhaling but connect the inhaling and exhaling, so you can notice both inhaling and exhaling as one continuous breath.
  3. Fixing
      1. After joining inhaling and exhaling, fix your mind on the point where you feel you inhaling and exhaling breath touching. Inhale and exhale as on single breath moving in and out touching or rubbing the rims of your nostrils.
  4. Focus your mind like a carpenter
      1. Keep your mind straight on the point where you feel the breath at the rims of your nostrils.
  5. Make your mind like a gate-keeper
      1. When you concentrate you should not take into account any detail of your experiences.
      2. Simply notice the feeling of your inhaling and exhaling breath as it goes in and out right at the rims of your nostrils.

> Every time the mind returns to the breath, it comes back with a deeper insight into impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and selflessness. The mind becomes more insightful from the impartial and unbiased watching of these occurrences. The mind gains insight into the fact that this body, these feelings, various states of consciousness and numerous mental formations are to be used only for the purpose of gaining deeper insight into the reality of this mind/body complex.
